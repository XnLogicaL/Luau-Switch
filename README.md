# Luau-Switch
A lightweight library to attempts to bring "switch" statements to Roblox.

A switch statement is similar to an `if` statement, but there are some key differences.
For one, the switch statement evaluates sequentally. Which means that each `case` will be evaluated even though the switches value has been matched.
